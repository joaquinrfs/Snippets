# Git

Git is a _Source Code Management_ software made for... managing source code. It's considered the programmer's absolute tool for code versioning and one of the things everyone working in software development should know how to use.

## Download and Install

Many Linux distros come with Git pre-installed, you can check by running:

```
git -v
```

Otherwise, you can follow the instructions from the official [Git website](https://git-scm.com/).

- This will also set a default code branch called `master` or `main`.
- When you tell Git to track a file in the folder, it will be added to the "staging area", where the file will wait until you "commit" it to the repository.
